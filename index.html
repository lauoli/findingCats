      <h1> Lost pets and the science of searching </h1>
      <p> <i> by Laura M. Olivieri Robles</i></p>

      <p> Did you lose your cat? Your pet’s personality may give you insights on their whereabouts.</p>
      <p>Researchers tallied the most effective ways and tactics to search for a lost cat and published their findings in the journal Animals last January 2018. </p>
      <p>The study was a major milestone for Kat Albrecht, a pet detective pioneer, who collaborated in the study’s design. Back in 1997, when Albrecht, 58, went from law enforcement to pet detection, there were a handful of people working as professional
        pet detectives and no technical insight on how to search for missing pets. </p>
      <p>“We study lost person behavior, why have we not studied lost pet behavior?” Albrecht asked herself. “The data is right there, all you have to do is interview people who lost a dog or a cat and then found it." </p>
      <p> Researchers collected data such as the search methods used, location found and distance traveled by lost pets from an online survey in the United States and Australia. Click the images below to read some of the major highlights of the study. </p>

        <img class="that" id="Mission" src="img/mission.png" data-src="img/mission-2.png" data-description='People that went out to search for their cats were more likely to be reunited with them, the survey found. Shocker, right? But it is not uncommon to seek help, more than half of the owners interviewed turned to professional help for the quest. &#xa;&#xa;“I gave them hope,” Kat Albrecht, a pet detective pioneer and director of Missing Animal Response Network, said. “And the technical instructions on how and where to search, because I’ve been trained in the science of looking for people, that is search and rescue.”'

        <img class="that " id="Season " src="img/season.png " data-src="img/season-2.png " data-description="Even pet escapes have a season, according to Danielle Robertson a pet detective in Massachusetts, who starts receiving calls about lost pets when it’s hot enough to keep doors and windows open. &#xa; &#xa;Researchers from a different study were surprised to learn that dogs and cats were reported lost at similar rates yet dogs were more likely to be found than cats. &#xa; &#xa;Before Albrecht retired on 2013, she used to get three to five calls a day from people looking to get some assistance. Now, she offers online courses to train people and dogs for pet rescue that can start at $300. A phone consult with Danielle Robertson, one of Albrecht’s alumni, based in Massachusetts could cost $120."

        <img class="that " id="Traits " src="img/traits.png " data-src="img/traits-2.png " data-description="To find if there was an association between the cat’s personality and the location they were found, researchers asked pet owners to rank them on a scale of 1 to 5 for traits like curious, aloof, cautious and timid. &#xa; &#xa;The most curious cats, according to their owners, were often found snooping inside neighbor’s houses.&#xa; &#xa;“A backpacker, a berry picker and a deer hunter could all be lost in the same area of the woods but the tactic, technique and resources used to find them are entirely different,” said Kat Albrecht, a pet detective. Albrecht, used behavioral information to inform her searches for lost pets."
